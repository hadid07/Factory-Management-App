Perfect. For a non-technical user, **simplicity and clarity** are more important than visual complexity. Here's a UI suggestion focused on **ease of use and speed**:

---

### ✅ **Minimal & Simple UI Guidelines**

#### 🧭 Sidebar Navigation (Always Visible)

* **Big icons + labels**
* Example:

  * 🏠 Dashboard
  * ➕ Add Sale
  * 💸 Add Expense
  * 👤 Customers
  * 📊 Reports

---

### 🏠 **Dashboard (Default View)**

* Show:

  * 📅 Date
  * 🧾 Total sales today
  * 📦 Sales by category
  * 💰 Payments received today
  * 💸 Expenses today
  * ✅ Profit = Sales - Expenses
* Use large cards with bold text
* Avoid charts unless really simple

---

### ➕ **Add Sale Page**

* Simple form with:

  * Date (auto-filled to today)
  * Select product category (dropdown)
  * Quantity + Price
  * Customer name (dropdown or auto-complete)
  * Paid or Credit toggle
  * **\[Add to List]** button (adds it to a table below before saving)
* Finally a **\[Save All Sales]** button

---

### 💸 **Add Expense Page**

* Form:

  * Expense type (dropdown: fuel, food, etc.)
  * Amount
  * Notes
  * Date (default today)
* Simple **\[Add Expense]** button

---

### 👤 **Customers Page**

* List of customers (name + pending amount)
* Click to view:

  * Purchase history
  * Payments
  * Add payment form
* Keep layout like WhatsApp contact list

---

### 📊 **Reports Page**

* Filter by:

  * Day / Week / Month
* Show:

  * Total sales
  * Category-wise sales
  * Total expenses
  * Total profit
* Use simple text tables, optionally export as PDF later

---

### 🔐 Login (Optional)

* Just a simple login with hardcoded admin password (if needed)

Let me know if you want me to design a quick UI wireframe next, or suggest a MongoDB schema for this structure.
